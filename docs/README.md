## LDTS_L08GR07 - Bomberman

> Include here one or two paragraphs explaining the main idea of the project.

In this remake of the NES classic, Bomberman, you will be able to help again the robot Bomberman find his way through a maze, while avoiding enemies that try to stop you. The maze is composed of several levels that you can advance to the next one by finding the door and going through it. 

This project was developed by *Diogo Sarmento* (up...), *Manuel Neto* (*up202108744*@fe.up.pt) and *Tomás Vicente* (*up202108717@fe.up.pt*) for LDTS 2022⁄23.

### IMPLEMENTED FEATURES



### PLANNED FEATURES

- Place bombs - Bomberman will place a bomb when the X key is pressed.
- Explode rocks - When the bomb's explosion reaches a rock, it will dissapear and there is a chance of it dropping an upgrade.
- Upgrading your character - After collecting your upgrade, your character will be upgraded, either itself (higher speed, ability to pass through bombs or walls,...) or to the bombs (higher explosion area, on bomb's explosion triggering another one's).
- Kill enemies - When the bomb's explosion reaches an enemy, it will kill it.
- Die - The player can lose the game if they die, either if they explode themselves with a bomb or an enemy gets to them.
